Django
======

`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ is a secure and scalable framework designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion quickly. 
It includes built-in protection against many common web application vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection. 
**Django**'s security features are continuously updated, making it a preferred choice for applications that handle sensitive data.
