`Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/>`__ is a server-side framework that facilitates the development of web applications and RESTful APIs. 
It leverages Werkzeug for WSGI utilities and Jinja2 for templating, providing a robust foundation for handling HTTP requests and generating dynamic content. 
**Flask**'s seamless integration with these powerful libraries enables developers to create sophisticated web applications with minimal overhead.
