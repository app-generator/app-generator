Tailwind
=====================

`Tailwind CSS <https://tailwindcss.com/>`__ is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom user interfaces rapidly. 
Unlike traditional CSS frameworks, **Tailwind** doesn't provide pre-built components. 
Instead, it offers low-level utility classes that you can combine to create unique designs directly in your HTML. **Here are the key points of Tailwind CSS**:

- Utility-first approach: Classes represent single-purpose styling options.
- Highly customizable: Easy to adapt to your project's specific design needs.
- Responsive design: Built-in responsive modifiers for different screen sizes.
- JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler: Generates styles on-demand, reducing file size.
- Pseudo-class variants: Easy styling for hover, focus, and other states.
- Dark mode support: Built-in classes for dark mode implementations.
- Extensible: Can be easily extended with custom utilities and plugins.

Now, comparing it to Bootstrap is kind of like comparing a custom tailor to a department store. 
Bootstrap gives you ready-to-wear outfits – they look good, they're easy to put on, but everyone might end up looking a bit similar. **Tailwind**, on the other hand, gives you the fabric and tools to make your own unique outfit.
