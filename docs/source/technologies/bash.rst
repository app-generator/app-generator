Bash
====

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne Shell. It's the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS.
Bash scripts can leverage a wide array of external utilities, support variables, arrays, functions, and command substitution, enabling users to automate complex workflows, 
perform system maintenance, and create sophisticated command-line tools.
