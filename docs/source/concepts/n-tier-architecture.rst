N-Tier Architecture
===================

Two-tier architecture separates an application into two logical layers: the client tier (user interface and business logic) and the data tier (database). 
N-tier architecture extends this concept, introducing additional layers like a separate business logic tier and data access tier. 
These architectural patterns improve scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns in complex systems.
